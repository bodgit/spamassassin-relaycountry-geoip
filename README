An updated SpamAssassin plugin to replace the current RelayCountry plugin.

The main problem with the current RelayCountry plugin is it doesn't support
IPv6, this is entirely down to the underlying IP::Country module used to do
the IP -> Country lookups.

The Geo::IP module that uses the Maxmind GeoIP C library and data files has
both IPv4 and IPv6 data available so it is an ideal choice. The data files
can just be downloaded from the website which fixes another annoying problem
with IP::Country; you need to build updated data files yourself and they can
take a fair chunk of memory.

Enable the plugin with the usual:

loadplugin Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::RelayCountry2

Don't enable it at the same time as the original RelayCountry plugin as
both plugins will try and create the same metadata/headers.

I've replicated the behaviour of IP::Country in that it returns '**' for
private IPv4 addresses and I've also added similar rules for the standard
set of private IPv6 addresses as per the relevant RFC.
